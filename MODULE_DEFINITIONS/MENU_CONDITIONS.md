# WP Menu Queries

**Name**: WP Menu Conditions
**Description**: Adds the ability to conditionally display menu items based on Abilities API
**Settings**: None yet
 **Logo**: Create a basic square logo for testing

# General
Register Core Abilities for each standard WP Role. My understanding is that WP does not currently define Core Abilities. So that we can use Abilities to determine if a user has a specific role.  Namespace "wordpress", ability is the role.

 # Admin Functionality
 Adds a button to all Menu Items in Customise->Menus and Appearance->Menus. The button opens a Modal in the same way the Our QUery Item does.

 The Modal will have Repeater for conditions. When there is more than one Item in the Repeater, there will be a AND/OR toggle to set the logical relationship between the items.

 Each repeater item will have a
  - Toggle Has / Has Not
  - A Select listing registered abilities - Single item select.
